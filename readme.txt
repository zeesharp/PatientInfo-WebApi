Please note that as far as back-end part is concerned, I couldn't use .net core because there was some issue in my laptop in getting the required packages. Having said that, I used .net framework with Entity Frame work (Code first approach).
For front-end part, I used angular 9 with Angular Material (UI Component Library).

It could have been more better if I had more time to work, few of the enhancement, we could possibly implement is more structured form in vertical form and we can show animated notification once any patient is added, update or deleted.
